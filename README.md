# Shadowsocks blacklist

> ***Archiving note***
> I think it's overwhelming, and it's better to use manually created lists.

Use on `shadowsocks-android`: open the sidebar - open "Custom rules" - click the button at the top right - select "Manual Settings" - select "URL to online config" from the drop-down list and paste in the input field one of the following URLs:

- Main list: `https://istudyatuni.github.io/shadowsocks-blacklist/ru.acl`
- Additional list, contains URLs, which are filtered from main list by keywords from [filtered.txt](filtered.txt): `https://istudyatuni.github.io/shadowsocks-blacklist/ru-filtered.acl`
